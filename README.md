# Introduction

An example of a modern Spring Boot application using latest JDK LTS and Angular:
* [backend](./backend) - Contains the backend implemented in Spring Boot
* [frontend](./frontend) - Contains the frontend implemented in Angular
* [container](./container) - Contains a ContainerFile so you can build your own OCI-compliant container image (Note: It is up to you to secure it!)
* [config](./config) - Contains some example configurations

You will find further documentation (e.g. building, configuring etc.) in the corresponding subfolders.

This example project is supposed to be easily reused, so you can build your own complex application.
